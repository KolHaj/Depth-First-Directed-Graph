# Depth First Search Application to Build Directed Graph

The application takes a user text file that are provided in the resources' folder and tokenizes the contents and then uses that to create directed graph. 
The program then takes the class to recompile input to topologically sort the output into a string output.

## Getting Started

The project is built using Java so using any IDE that supports Java will work and can be used to create a .jar file to run in the desktop. 
For the application to work you will need to use either your own created text files, or the text files provided in the resources' folder of the
project.
